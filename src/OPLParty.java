/**
 * Represents a political party in the context of an Open Party List (OPL) voting system. This class
 *  serves as a distinct type within the OPL system, potentially accommodating future
 * OPL-specific attributes
 * <p>
 * In an OPL voting system, voters cast their votes for individual candidates rather for the parties,
 * but the total votes received by a party's candidates influence the number of seats allocated to that party.
 *  {@code OPLParty} exist as a separate class to allows for OPL's enhancements without
 * impacting the general party model or the model used by other voting systems.
