/**
 * This class extends the {@link Party} class, inheriting its basic characteristics such as party name, vote counts, and
 * candidate management. It serves as a distinct type that could be expanded in the future attributes or behaviors.
 * <p>
 * In a CPL voting system, parties submit a fixed list of candidates. Voters cast their ballots for parties
 * rather than individual candidates, with seats being allocated to parties based on their share of the vote,
 * and candidates being awarded seats based on their position in the party list.
